      Your roommate in veterinary school failed her first anatomy test. She was very upset as this is the first failing grade she had ever received. She was determined
      to bring up her grade on the next exam so she studied every night after school from the time she got home
      until 1:00am including the weekends. The harder she studied, the more stressed out she became. Despite all of
      this hard work, she did poorly on the next exam as well. By the end of the first semester she is in danger of
      failing out. How do you advise her?
