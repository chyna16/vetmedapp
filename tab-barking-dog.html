      A young family is considering having their 2 year-old FS Beagle be
      debarked. It is not illegal in NY but many people believe debarking is
      unethical because it is a surgery that has no benefit to the dog. However,
      the owners live in a rent-controlled apartment building in Manhattan and
      the building manager is threatening eviction based on other tenant
      complaints. They do not want to give up the dog, the children are very
      attached. What do you think about this situation? Please be advised that
      there is no right or wrong answer.

        Jan 1, 2019 JAVMA news reaffirmed the existing policy on canine devocalization. There is broad opposition to the
        procedure however exceptions are recognized. The current policy reads as follows.
        “Canine devocalization should on be performed by qualified, licensed veterinarians as a final alternative to
        euthanasia after behavioral modification to correct excessive vocalization has failed and after potential
        complications have been discussed with the owner”
