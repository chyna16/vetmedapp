                            Mr. Jones was just offered a new job in Denver, Colorado and will be moving with his family in a few
                            weeks. Unfortunately, under Denver’s Ordinance Sec. 8-55, “pit-bull type” breeds are banned from the
                            City and animal protection can impound your dog and force you to relocate it or euthanize it. He now
                            must tell his son that their family pet, “Tiny”, cannot go with them. Mr. Jones is planning on
                            taking the dog to the Babylon shelter tomorrow.

                    <p> In a study published in 2008 by the Coalition for living Safely with dogs, dog bites were
                        most
                        common in the following breeds:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Labrador retrievers: 13.3%</li>
                        <li>Pit Bulls: 8.4%</li>
                        <li>German Shepherds: 7.8% </li>
                        <li>Rottweilers: 3.9%</li>
                        <li>Chows: 3.5% </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Labradors lead the pack with the greatest number of attacks, which is a surprising discovery
                        when considering the mild nature of the dogs. However, the number of dog bites is related to
                        popularity of the breed: the more popular a dog is, the more likely one will have a negative
                        encounter with a human. All breeds can be poorly trained, poorly socialized, neglected which
                        will increase their likelihood of aggression. There is no evidence that Pit Bull dogs as a
                        breed, are any more likely to be naturally aggressive than other breeds. However, they may
                        be
                        owned by more lower income families which may not have the resources for early training and
                        neutering. One Notes may be providing more resources in underserved areas.
                        Fighting against breed-specific education is one Notes. Some places (Denver, CO. Miami, FL.
                        Council Bluffs, IA among others) outright ban the ownership of Pit Bulls. Many home-owners
                        policies include a caveat that they can refuse coverage it you own specific breeds of dogs
                        including Pit Bulls.
